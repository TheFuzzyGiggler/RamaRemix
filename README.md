# Rama Idler Remix

This is a remix of the famous Ramalama Idlers for Voron printers.\
The originals had an issue of the idler itself canting to one side or another during tensioning.

To solve this, I replaced the M3 screw tensioning setup with a pair of 5mm dowel pins.\
I also changed the tensioning method by using an M4 socket head screw from the rear.\
This screw pushes on the rear of the idler and the dowel pins keep the idler collinear to the belts.

## BOM

In addition to the bearings and bearing pin on the original, you'll need the following:\
2 - 5mm x 25mm dowel pins\
1 - M4 heatset insert\
1 - M4 x 15mm SHCS (Socket Head Cap Screw)

## Instructions

With the idler and cover removed, push the heat set insert in from the top into the hole in the center of the idler holder.\
Insert the M4 SHCS from the rear until it threads into the insert.

Dowel pins go into the holes where the M3 screws were in the original.

Due to the variability of FDM, you may need to drill out the 5mm holes for the dowel pins to make them fit correctly.
